You must ONLY output the JSON object, nothing else.
NO descriptions of what you're doing before or after JSON.
Always respond with ONLY a JSON object in the format: 
{{"questions": ['1.q1', '2.q2', ...]}}
</output_format>

<note>
- [CRITICAL] Maintain the same language as the user request
- Questions should be designed to gather comprehensive information without overwhelming the user
- Focus on understanding the user's intent, goals, and requirements
